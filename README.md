# 🛡 Private Match | Secure Matrimony Profile Sharing  

## 📝 About This Project  
In India, especially in **South India**, many families prefer **local brokers and family references** over matrimonial websites to find a bride or groom. However, sharing profiles through **WhatsApp or PDFs** is risky as they can be misused.

That’s why I am building Private Match – a platform that allows safe and controlled profile sharing while preventing screenshots, downloads, and unauthorized access.

✨ Completely developed with AI assistance, this project ensures privacy and security for families and individuals.

## 🔮 Future Plans  
We plan to **upgrade Private Match** with the following:  

### 1️⃣ Backend & Database (PostgreSQL)  
- Store profiles securely in a **PostgreSQL database**  
- Host the database using **Coolify VPS**  

### 2️⃣ Expiring Links System  
- Generate **unique, temporary links** for each profile  
- Links **automatically expire after a set time**  

### 3️⃣ User Authentication  
- Allow **profile owners** to **log in & manage their profiles**  
- Secure login using **JWT authentication**  

### 4️⃣ Advanced Security  
- **Watermark images** to prevent screenshots  
- **Block screen recording** using CSS tricks**
